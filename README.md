# LeagueofDrafts
League of Legends is a pretty popular MOBA and I play it occassionally, mainly with my friends. We get into arguments about which champions to play to create an inherent advantage before the game starts. This is what many people call "winning the draft". Winning a League game requires more than just the better draft of course, but the better draft tends to make winning the game easier and allows for more leeway given a disparity in skill. How would I know who won draft? There's no better way than a trained model to give me an accurate predictor on who really won. Given evenly matched opponents, which team chose the better champions? Trained off a dataset of 20000+ matches from the top 150+ players on the ladder, the model will give a more accurate answer than the average player eye-balling or feeling it out.
